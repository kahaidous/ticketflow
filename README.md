# TicketFlow

**A hands-on reference project for learning Spring Cloud and microservices, built around a real-world ticket booking platform.**

TicketFlow is an open-source educational project that takes you from
"what is a microservice?" to building resilient, event-driven, observable
distributed systems with the Spring ecosystem.

Instead of yet another e-commerce demo, it tackles problems that naturally
require distributed-systems patterns: limited seat inventory, concurrent
bookings, unreliable payment providers, and asynchronous notifications.

## What you will learn

- **Service discovery & routing**: Eureka and Spring Cloud Gateway
- **Centralized configuration**: Spring Cloud Config with dynamic refresh
- **Inter-service communication**: declarative REST clients with OpenFeign
- **Resilience**: circuit breaker, retry, timeout, bulkhead and fallbacks (Resilience4J)
- **Event-driven architecture**: asynchronous messaging with Apache Kafka
- **Distributed transactions**: Saga pattern, Outbox pattern, idempotency
- **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose
- **AI integration** *(later)*: natural-language search and RAG assistant with Spring AI

## Architecture

| Module | Role | Key technology | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `discovery-server` | Service registry | Eureka | Planned |
| `config-server` | Centralized configuration | Spring Cloud Config | Planned |
| `api-gateway` | Single entry point, routing, rate limiting | Spring Cloud Gateway | Planned |
| `event-service` | Events and seats catalog | Spring Web, JPA | Planned |
| `booking-service` | Booking and seat locking | OpenFeign, Resilience4J | Planned |
| `payment-service` | Simulated payment provider (random failures) | Resilience4J | Planned |
| `notification-service` | Confirmation emails/SMS | Kafka consumer | Planned |
| `customer-service` | Customer profiles | Keycloak, OpenFeign | Planned |
| `ai-assistant-service` | Natural-language search, recommendations | Spring AI | Later |

## Roadmap

Each step has a Git tag and a lesson in `docs/lessons/`.

| Tag | Content |
|---|---|
| `step-00-setup` | Parent POM, repo structure, CI |
| `step-01-discovery` | Eureka |
| `step-02-config` | Config Server |
| `step-03-event-service` | First business service |
| `step-04-gateway` | Gateway and routing |
| `step-05-booking-feign` | booking-service + OpenFeign |
| `step-06-resilience` | payment-service + Resilience4J |
| `step-07-kafka` | Events + notification-service |
| `step-08-saga` | Saga, Outbox, idempotency |
| `step-09-security` | Keycloak + customer-service |
| `step-10-observability` | Tracing and metrics |
| `step-11-ai` | Spring AI |

To follow a lesson, check out its tag: `git checkout step-01-discovery`.

## Tech stack

Java 21 · Spring Boot 4 · Spring Cloud 2025.1 · Resilience4J · Apache Kafka ·
PostgreSQL · Docker / Docker Compose · Spring AI (later)

## Repository structure

    ticketflow/
    ├── docs/            # lessons, ADRs, templates
    ├── infra/           # docker-compose and infrastructure config
    ├── config-repo/     # configuration served by the config server
    └── services/        # one folder per microservice, each with its own README

Every module is independently runnable and testable, and documents itself in
its own `README.md`.

## Getting started

Prerequisites: JDK 21, Maven (or the included wrapper), Docker.

    git clone https://github.com/<your-user>/ticketflow.git
    cd ticketflow
    mvn clean verify

## Who is this for?

Java developers who know Spring Boot basics and want to move into
microservices, and anyone preparing for backend or architecture interviews.
